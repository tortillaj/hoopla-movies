# Fetch movies from Hoopla

Small example using react, redux, and redux-sagas to fetch movies from Hoopla's API.

To view,
1. Install dependencies with `npm install` or `yarn install`
2. Run the dev server with `npm start` or `yarn start`

This isn't meant to be a finished product. It just demonstrates how to connect react to an API via redux and sagas. Immutable data structures are used to reinforce react best practices.

Projects in use:
- react
- react-redux
- redux-sagas
- immutable.js
- axios (Could probably switch to fetch if you wanted)
- Sass
- webpack
- yarn
